# ModuleManagementApp
It is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing course modules. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete module records stored in an H2 in-memory database. The project uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions and includes a simple front-end for testing API endpoints.
